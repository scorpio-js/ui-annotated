# SCORPIO - User Interfaces

Scorpio turns textual specifications into diagrams.

This repo illustrates how to use GitHub to store marked up images for display as Scorpio diagrams (gitwrapping). 

View these files converted to diagrams at [scorpio diagrams](http://scorpiodiagrams.com/gitwrapped.html)


## Sub directories

+ *./images/* - subdirectory has png images which become annotated
+ *./diagrams/* - contains the specs for the annotations
+ *./wiki/* - is for the documents the diagrams are embedded in.

## The build step

There is no build step.

The text and diagrams are all rendered client side using JavaScript.
